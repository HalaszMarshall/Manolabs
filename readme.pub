1. How to get manolabs.ro and manolabs.ro/index be exactly the same content
2. To create a number of empry class divs, use " .*n " and enter while tooltip suggestion bar is active.
3. In order to override a "justify-content" property for one item (ex. all navbar items moved to the right besides 1 item - manolabs) you can use "margin-right:auto" on the single item (in order to move it to the left).
4. Use (no . in css before it)"body{ margin:0;}" in order to remove default margin around divs.
5. In order to adjust space between <ul><li> items, use, "ul.classname{line-height: 1.5;}"
6. When using "rgba" DO NOT put a space between "rgba" and "()" as color picker will not appear and  it will not work
ex. "background-image: linear-gradient(to top, rgba(0,0,0,0),  rgba(0,0,0,1));"
7. In order to have a Flexbox element positioned Fixed (like a navbar) you need the following css:
position: fixed;
display: flex;
top: 0;
left: 0;
right: 0;

8. In order to use the same CSS Class properties on different pages with specific elements changed on every page, Use the same class on all pages and a different ID for every page and in the CSS create the Common elements in the Class and the differences for each ID.

ex. 
.class{common elements for all pages}
.class#page1{difference from common for page 1}
.class#page2{difference from common for page 2}

ex.
body{body elements}
body#index{background-image:1}
body#about{background-image:2}
