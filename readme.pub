3. In order to override a "justify-content" property for one item (ex. all navbar items moved to the right besides 1 item - manolabs) you can use "margin-right:auto" on the single item (in order to move it to the left).
4. Use (no . in css before it)"body{ margin:0;}" in order to remove default margin around divs.
5. In order to adjust space between <ul><li> items, use, "ul.classname{line-height: 1.5;}"
6. When using "rgba" DO NOT put a space between "rgba" and "()" as color picker will not appear and  it will not work
ex. "background-image: linear-gradient(to top, rgba(0,0,0,0),  rgba(0,0,0,1));"
7. In order to have a Flexbox element positioned Fixed (like a navbar) you need the following css:
position: fixed;
display: flex;
top: 0;

right: 0;

8. In order to use the same CSS Class properties on different pages with specific elements changed on every page, Use the same class on all pages and a different ID for every page and in the CSS create the Common elements in the Class and the differences for each ID.

ex. 
.class{common elements for all pages}
.class#page1{difference from common for page 1}
.class#page2{difference from common for page 2}

ex.
body{body elements}
body#index{background-image:1}
body#about{background-image:2}

9. In order to jump to a specific part of the page when opening it, add an ID to that part of the page and use that ID after the link address (open THIS link at THIS ID)
ex. <a href="index.html#footer">

10. In order to use Fontawesome icons, use this website for the stylesheet: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome .

11. To create a Glow around your element, use - box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgb(252, 236, 15, .9);
box-shadow: 
0 - shadow position left-right
0 - shadow position up-down
10px - shadow size
rgb(252, 236, 15, .9) - shadow color and opacity

12. If a background image file size is larger than the container, object-fit will not fit the image to the container, parts of it will disappear outside of cont. . You can add <img> tag inside <div class="containerProperties"><img src:"image"></div> and in CXX you will have to create the class .containerProperties img{} otherwise img will overflow other content.


To do list:
1.fit background image
2.see if possible to scale container width based on inner text (so that we would not need a sepparate class for a wider containerex Hardware vs Firmware container on index page)
3.footer hyperlinks - new page paragraph title hidden behind NavBar
